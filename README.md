# Digital-Image-Forensics

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/sophatvathana/casia-dataset

In this project, we provide two approach in order to detect authentic and tampered images by implementing the LBP (Local Binary Pattern) descriptor on the 
input images and also the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) descriptor is applied on the input image and eventually they are classified into the two 
completely different classes: Authentic Images and Tampered Images, adopting the various classifiers respectively. The structured model enforced on the 
CASIA 2 databases from Kaggle . The time complexity is also significantly reduced and the method is found to be working well under diverse illuminating 
variation conditions.

LBP and HOG code are included in it.
